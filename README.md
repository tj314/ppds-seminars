# Seminar examples 2024
This is the branch for the code examples from the 2024 seminars.

The source code from each seminar can be found in its respective directory.

## General instructions
These examples are tested with `Python 3.12.x`. You also need to install [fei.ppds](https://pypi.org/project/fei.ppds/) library. We highly recommend using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
